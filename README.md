Guiding Question:
- Always prefix the project title with "WD-" followed by your custom naming.
- Do not rename any .html files; always use index.html as the filename.
- Ensure files are placed in their respective folders.
- Use camel case for all file naming.
- Camel case is a naming format where there are no spaces between words; the first word is all lowercase, and the first letter of each subsequent word is uppercase followed by lowercase letters.
Example: style.css
- Use only external CSS.
- Renaming of folders is required and should reflect their purpose or the data they contain.
